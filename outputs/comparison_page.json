  "similarities": [
    "Both are Vitamin C serums formulated to brighten skin and fade dark spots.",
    "Both are suitable for oily and combination skin types.",
    "Both are recommended for morning application before sunscreen.",
    "Both contain a potent form of Vitamin C (likely L-Ascorbic Acid, given potential for tingling)."
  ],
  "differences": [
    "Concentration: GlowBoost contains 10% Vitamin C, while RadiantDefense offers a higher 15% L-Ascorbic Acid for potentially more potent results.",
    "Key Supporting Ingredients: GlowBoost pairs Vitamin C with Hyaluronic Acid for basic hydration. RadiantDefense includes Ferulic Acid and Vitamin E, a popular combination that enhances Vitamin C's stability and antioxidant power.",
    "Price: GlowBoost is priced at 699, making it slightly more budget-friendly. RadiantDefense is priced at 899, reflecting its higher concentration and more complex antioxidant blend.",
    "Potential Irritation: While both can cause mild tingling, RadiantDefense's higher concentration of L-Ascorbic Acid might lead to a stronger initial reaction for some sensitive individuals, as noted in its description ('May cause mild redness or tingling, particularly for sensitive skin or during initial use')."

  "which_is_better_for": {
    "oily_skin": "RadiantDefense C-Bright Serum could be slightly better for oily skin types seeking more advanced brightening and robust antioxidant protection, thanks to its higher 15% concentration and the inclusion of Ferulic Acid and Vitamin E. GlowBoost remains an excellent, slightly gentler option for those starting with Vitamin C.",
    "dry_skin": "Neither product is optimally formulated for dry skin, as both target oily/combination types. However, GlowBoost Vitamin C Serum, with its Hyaluronic Acid, might offer a touch more hydration, making it marginally preferable. Dry skin types might need to layer either product with a richer moisturizer or seek a Vitamin C serum with more emollient ingredients.",
    "sensitive_skin": "GlowBoost Vitamin C Serum, with its 10% concentration, is likely the safer starting point for sensitive skin. The lower concentration means a reduced risk of irritation, redness, or tingling. RadiantDefense C-Bright Serum's 15% L-Ascorbic Acid, while effective, poses a higher risk of adverse reactions for very sensitive individuals, making a patch test even more crucial."
