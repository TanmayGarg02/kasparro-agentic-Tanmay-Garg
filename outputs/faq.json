    "Comparison": [
      {
        "question": "How does the 10 percent Vitamin C concentration in GlowBoost compare to serums with higher or lower percentages?",
        "answer": "The 10 percent Vitamin C concentration in GlowBoost is an ideal balance, offering effective brightening and dark spot fading benefits while generally being well-tolerated by most skin types, including those prone to sensitivity. Serums with higher concentrations (e.g., 15-20%) can be more potent but also carry a higher risk of irritation, especially for new users. Lower concentrations (e.g., 5%) are gentler but may take longer to show noticeable results. GlowBoost strikes an excellent balance between efficacy and minimal irritation."

Its formulation avoids heavy emollients often found in serums designed for dry skin, ensuring it supports skin clarity and doesn't contribute to excess oiliness. The 10% Vitamin C concentration is effective without being overly rich or potentially problematic for these skin concerns."

      {
        "question": "How does GlowBoost Vitamin C Serum compare to other brightening or dark spot fading products you offer?",

While we may offer other products targeting similar concerns through different mechanisms or for different skin types, GlowBoost is optimized for daily use to deliver powerful antioxidant protection, promote radiant skin, and achieve an even tone, without being heavy or occlusive. It's an excellent starting point for those new to Vitamin C or seeking a reliable daily option."
